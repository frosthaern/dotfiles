* todo
- do leetcode first thing in the morning
- then play chess and learn some openings
- then practice some mcsr
** ai related
- Here’s a list of the main research topics (project proposals) covered in the PDF:
- Statistical Analysis of Attention Head Activations in Code Retrieval
- Layer-wise Embedding Interpretability in Code Search
- Uncovering Latent Programming Concepts in BERT-Based Models
- Comparative Study of BERT Variants for Code Retrieval
- Comparing Embeddings for Secure vs. Insecure Code
- Embedding-Based Detection and Classification of Bad Code
- Comparative Analysis of Code Metrics Across Programming Languages
- Each topic dives into different aspects of how BERT-based models work with code, from understanding internal attention mechanisms to comparing code metrics across languages. These are the areas you’d need to learn, even if you’re starting from scratch.

** presentation and 3d modelling using something

* project descriptions
** make a program to token generator
- why: because give whole code to llm is just too much context
- make bytecode such that the idea of the whole program stays
- all important methods and functions stays
- but useless things should not stay
- make plan
- make project
- so that you can help decrease the load on llm companies
- read that massive distributed computing book
- read that compiler book

** mohit's winkel ( trading platform for ramaiah )
- Landing page
- Auth (you can customize or use clerk one only)
- Feed for listings
- way to view each listing
- viewing profile
- creating a post in the feed
- carousels for viewing multiple images in the listing
- displaying listing attributes
- either session token or jwt should have first and last name, ID from clerk (which will be stored in db) and whatever else is required.
- phone number for doing communication and they will meet and do trade and not in our platform
- the above is more or less specification
- a dashboard for controlling what items are there
- a good ui is important

** python script for pywal chromium
- just write an extension and use that python library to change colorscheme


** implement what tsoding is doing right no
- or read a fucking book and implement shit from there
- like crafting interpreters or some shit like that
